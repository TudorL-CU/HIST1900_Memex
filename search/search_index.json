Many people think of history as just a timeline of events, when in fact it is incredibly damaging to view of history this way. This is because we get so used to this timeline of events that we begin to think of history as just this one objective thing to look at, when in actuality history depends on the context you look at it from. The history we are taught in schools and see growing up is just one context, and for people all around the globe history can take on many different timelines and many different contexts. For example,  the context when looking at the history of the internet can change depending on what geographical region you're from. And it's their where our journey begins. Comparing Digital Divides- Internet Access and Social Inequality in Canada and the United States is an interesting article that looks at inequality and the governance of the internet, and looks at the divide between internet use by gender and other criteria. With so much of modern life taking place on the internet, disparities and different groups of people being more prevalent on the internet than others can lead to unintentional framings of history. Having diverse contexts and views is essential to maintaining a constructive society, but when people in power push for one context becomes the overwhelming majority, it leads to a more objective version of history being taught, which is bad. One stellar example of this is computer science culture today. Programming has a stereotype for being a male dominated field, and the statistics certainly back this up. But when you look at history, hasn't it always been this way? Indeed, on the objective timeline lots of computer science discoveries and programming designs were by men, such as the ENIAC. However, if you do more research, you find out that the vast majority, if not all, of the people who actually inserted the cards into the computer were women. So, programming to start off was a women dominated field, so why is it so male dominated now? Well, you can say it is because the context behind programming shifted. In early computer science, programming was thought of as a largely menial task, it was something that nobody valued, so the men handed it off to the women. Because the perception of programming was that it was an irrelevant job, these early women never really got written into the timeline of history, unlike their male counterparts. The men in charge, when eventually seeing that there is money to be made in programming, push for their male colleagues to be programmers, pushing women out of the industry. This of course had an absolutely massive impact on the perception of programming by the general public, as well as changing its historical context. The context for programming changing from 'for women' to 'for men' because of the powerful people that wanted it to be that way, we end up in the situation we're in today. This of course relates to the geographical context of the internet as questioned in Atomic Notes 3, where I ask what would the history of the internet look like from the context of Russia, or other countries? We largely know the americanized version of the history of the internet, well because Canada is next door to them, but also because of their historical status as a world power. When one entity holds so much influence, they can control how people perceive things. When over 50% of internet content is in english, you can begin to see how the anglosphere, and largely US based companies, can influence what content people talk about, and what specific historical contexts for events people are aware of. The things people are aware of is made worse by user content, bringing us to Benj Edwards article on My Secret Life as an 11-Year-Old BBS Sysop. The emergence of online communities was probably the first step towards the enshittification of the internet, despite the good they bring. When companies realized they could take advantage of large online communities based on specific niches, like a computer company advertising in a programming community, the arms race began. The commercialization of the internet involves an obscene amount of money(suprise, those in power are seen interfering wherever there is money to be found), and advertisers and people in power can use online communities with large userbases to spread propaganda. This same problem can be seen with other websites such as Google and Youtube, in which an algorithm decides what information is relevant to you. If the algorithm can be controlled to only show you certain contexts of events, most people are not going to go too far out of their way to background check those contexts, and so the objective historical timeline gets reinforced.  The Evolution of the Internet \u2013 Understanding Media and Culture mentions the money involved in social media, and internet business. With countless websites looking to diversify their revenue streams, it's not hard to see how advertisers could come along and invest money in these social platforms, with the seemingly innocent caveat of \"give my content a bit more views please\". </p> <p>With the increasing prevalence of the internet and online social platforms in everyday life, you can get stuck in a tunnel of being shown one thing after another, with advertisers controlling what you see, and powerful entities pushing you to see what they want you to see, influencing your views and thus your perception on history. In an era with so much (mis)information, it is becoming increasingly important to really think about what you're reading/watching/doing, and understand the context behind that piece of content. This is why I believe that the most powerful thing taught in this course was not who invented the internet or why social media exists, but that we have to look at all these things, and look to understand the different contexts behind them, whether it be the reasons why a a news outlet is covering an event in a certain way, or anything else you're not.</p>"},{"location":"Topic%201/0_Final_Journey_2/","title":"0 Final Journey 2","text":"<p>\"Did you meet the goals you set out to achieve for this course?

Being a computer science student, computers are a constant appearance in my everyday life, so when I was looking for an elective and saw the course description, I remember thinking to myself \"Isn't it a bit embarrassing that you spend all this time on your computer and on the internet yet you don't know anything about the history of it?\". So I enrolled and now here I am, answering the final question of the course. Of course feeling obligated to do the course is hardly any motivation to get involved in it, so going into the tutorial level I wanted to choose something else that I could get interested about. One thing that caught my eye was how humans are connected, and it got me thinking about the history of human connection, and how it relates to the internet. Of these two goals, I answered both. The first goal I answered all throughout the entire course, especially pertaining the section we covered on transmission protocols for networked systems, such as TCP/IP(which funny enough I later also covered in one of my computer science courses). The other goal is the one I want to deep dive into.</p> <p>One thing that really struck me was that essentially everything about networks and the internet is just one entity communicating a message to another. If you really think about it, sending an email to someone is sending them a message, your request communicates with servers, which then communicates with other servers and so on, which eventually communicates with that person, notifying them that you've sent them an email. In that sense, can we not say the true origins of the internet go back several hundred, if not thousands of years? But what does lighting fires in Greek times have to do with watching Youtube videos? They both communicate a message from one human to another, whether it be that enemy forces are fast approaching or that the new iPhone will have yet another camera. The history of human connection is tied as far back as our existence, and the modern internet is just an extension of the desire to communicate with one another. When communication is at risk, such as during wartime, innovations are made due to necessity of communication that advances our ability to send complex messages to each other.  Ciphers and codebooks used in Roman times lead to advanced cipher and code cracking machines seen in WWII, which in turn leads to the internet as we know it today, with large encryption techniques used to make sure nobody can hijack an email you send to your friend. Network protocols like A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication were developed for better communication between people. People like Paul Baran worked on distributed networks that would survive attacks to the system. Our desire to connect to each other and the importance it has on our lives is something we continuously strive to protect and improve, and with the invent of the internet, that connection has found even more ways to manifest itself. Perhaps the most prevalent form of connection on the internet is mass communication, in which one person sends a message out onto the open internet for anyone to see. A simple form of this is a youtube video, in which the uploader makes a video for anyone that comes across it to look at. This creates a connection between the viewers and the uploader, both in the form of the viewcount of the video as well as the information imparted on the viewer.  Vannevar Bush had a similar idea, with his memex. In his memex, people have a device where they store all their information, and can easily pull up multiple pages of information on the same desk at once. This repository of knowledge can be shared with other people, who take inspiration from some of your notes and improve on theirs, interlinking the two. This creates a connection between humans in the form of not only the sharing of opinions, but in the forwarding of that knowledge to other memexes, other repositories which in turn connect with more and more people. This would undoubtedly increase the human experience. When looking at Vannevar Bush and his memex, it is crucial to think about assemblage theory. In assemblage theory, there is an idea called agencement, which is the idea that things come together. The meaning is dependent on the context, and nothing is meaningful on its own. This incorporates itself into the idea of the memex because the relation and connections between pieces of shared knowledge attribute even more meaning to them. Shared knowledge then, would always have inevitably led to social media, as humans(being social animals), always have looked for more and better ways of being connected to one another. This leads to the creation of social media forums like BBSes and GeoCities, touched on in The Evolution of the Internet \u2013 Understanding Media and Culture. The popularity of social media forums on the modern internet, and their importance all throughout the history of the internet showcases how we continue to connect to one another. </p> <p>I never really thought about how just about everything we do on the internet is about communicating a message. The history of human connection is something that can looked at as far back as the existence of humans, and the invent of the internet, its advancements, culture, and explosion in popularity is an extension of that want to connect. Whether it is something as complex as collaborating on an in depth paper on string theory, or something as simple as sending a meme to your friend, communication is the purest form of connection, and the modern internet is the perfect embodiment of that.</p>"},{"location":"Topic%201/Archaeology%2C%20Theoretical%20Framework/","title":"Archaeology, Theoretical Framework","text":"<p>Archaelogy     - the science of human duration Theory is a framework for understanding the world and directing your attention     - theory tells you what is important and helps frame your questions     - there are many different theories to order our observations</p> <p>complicated vs complex systems     - complicated system is one with mechanical equipment which is controllable(ex. rocket ship)     - complex system is one in which the parts of the system are dynamic(ex. queensway)</p> <p>assemblage theory     - agencement is the idea that things come together     - the meaning depends on the context         - nothing is meaningful on its own         - a pot does not exist as the pot itself, but rather as the joining of different components of the pot - assemblage theory is especially important when looking at Vannevar Bush- As We May Think , the relations between pieces of information attributes more meaning to them</p> <p>perspectivism     - the way we record information matters     - we try to mirror 'natural breakages' but there are many ways to make decisions     - categories emerge from our engagement with the material</p> <p>a network is present whenever there is a relationship between two entities along which information flows     - networks form a substrate for social life, and humans aren't the only things that can have a social life     - networks leave physical traces     - more complex phenomena can emerge from interactions in networks     - networks provide a formal mechanism through which computation can happen         - computation is inherent to the shape of the network     - components of a networked history are not just the technical objects, but also the assemblage - the assemblage of networks to make the internet, the physical relationships between networks and humans, example would be The Evolution of the Internet \u2013 Understanding Media and Culture</p> <p>questions to ask when researching/learning     - what are the social/political/economic contexts of things?     - what are the assemblages that make this thing up?     - how do those assemblages extend in time and space?     - how do networks intersect?     - what drives network evolution?     - how do we study these things?</p>"},{"location":"Topic%201/Mediums%20and%20Messages/","title":"Mediums and Messages","text":"<ul> <li>the medium is the message<ul> <li>the medium is as important as the message</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>A medium is something that carries something else</p> <p>Media comes in different 'classses'     - classification of media and cataloguing controls knowledge and what is important     - who decides what is important?         - whoever makes that decision gains importance/power         - makes their vision of the world the most important one</p> <p>classifications both reflect and direct our thinking.

The historical timeline that Turing inhabits would look a lot different, America might not have the same power over the internet they do now</p> <p>combine information theory with Turing's universal computer and you have a way for a machine computer to simulate any of the work tat a human computer could do</p> <p>Babbage's design was essentially a souped up calculator     - died out because there was not much necessity for it</p> <p>counting machines didn't really become popular in the early 1900's     - people didn't think they needed computers for business     - counting machines used by 1930's germany(think nazis labeling population)         - ibm sold these counting machines, arguments later on said that indirectly ibm played a significant part in the holocaust</p> <p>'analog computers'     - work well for things like differential equations     -

first general purpose computer</p> <p>All these men design computers and calculators, but never gave a thought on how to actually operate it     - ignored WHO did the programming, and how long did it take to set the program up         - 6 women did the programming(re-wiring and writing the pages)             - took 15 seconds to get the result, but took a lot longer to set it up to get it to do the calculations         - study the engineering diagrams, reverse-engineer it         - this happened because there was already a big precedent on leaving math and programming to women             - also a small role was that during ww2, not enough men and these jobs were deemed 'trivial' - Mauchly's demonstration was a success     - the men went to go have a party that night, didn't invite the women</p> <p>Grace Hopper     - programmer, eventually sits down with some business people and creates a language for their computers to inter-operate         - that language eventually became COBOL(Common Business Oriented Language)</p> <p>Women get positions of power due to programming, but still get no credit     - the work that nobody valued is actually what everyone depended on     -

is essentially a substitution cypher     - increased amount of rotors increases the amount of settings for the enigma machine     - the beginning of deciphering the device is realizing that no letter can ever be encrypted as itself - Hut 8 and Bletchly Park     - Germans have a hard cipher to decrypt     - Turing worked in Hut 8 on computers during the war to break the german code     - not as advanced as computers in the US, but there was more of a necessity for these machines     - in 1942 germans slapped on another rotor to their enigma machine         - eventually realize what the germans did and were able to decrypt it by 1943     - these calculators were massively important in the war Bombe to Colossus     -

This computer network was installed at UCLA in fall of 1969, in December of that year it had 4 nodes operating. By 1989, this network expanded into a collection of networks consisting of over 60,000 nodes.</p> <p>The origins of the ARPANET come from the late 1950's, when the Department of Defense was concerned about the durability of their communication network in the case of a nuclear first strike attack against the US. After investigation, Paul Baran concluded that the most durable network would be a distributed network in which the loss of a number of nodes/links would not affect the sending of information from one node to another.</p> <p>The rapid growth of the network led to a reworking of the end-to-end protocol, changing it from NCP(Network Control Protocol), to a pair of protocols called TCP(Transport Control Protocol) and IP(Internet Protocol). A background of TCP/IP protocols can be found in A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication</p> <ul> <li>note: TCP/IP protocols are still the dominant communication model even today in 2023</li> </ul> <p>The author says that the foundations of networking that ARPANET laid the foundation of have not only influenced the future of networking technology, but has also led to shifts the everyday human practices.</p> <p>Finishes by posing questions about computer networks concerning security and private information stored on computer networks, and if/how you can truly make 'trusted computer systems'.</p> <p>Key Quotes</p> <p>(on a distributed computer network)\"would have sufficient redundancy so that the loss of subsets of links and nodes would not isolate any of the still-functioning nodes; there would be no central control; signals would traverse a series of nodes from source to destination, the exact route being determined by the set of working nodes and links at a particular time; and each node would contain routing information and could automatically reconfigure that information within a short time after the loss of a link or node.\"(Denning, 530).</p> <p>\"Networking has had an effect on the world more profound than that of the more spectacular and expensive Apollo moon mission\"(Denning, 532).</p> <p>\"A central question that arises from the interpretation of the Arpanet as part of a new technological discourse is, What other discourses will inevitably come together in the arena created by networking, and how can the design of networking in the future accommodate them? I see four major discourses: scientific technology, business, higher education, and government.\"(Denning, 533).</p> <p>\"If human practices external to a system of computers and networks generate distrust among those who must coordinate action, how can monitoring, auditing, and access control mechanisms restore trust?\"(Denning, 534).</p>"},{"location":"Topic%201/Memex%20Checkpoint%203/Class%20Notes%203/","title":"Class Notes 3","text":"<p>March 13  prune these notes </p> <p>Time for the internet? Competences - existence of digital computers, telecommunications networks, information theory     - ideas around flow control, logic, algorithms - remember that information theory allows us to separate the meaning of a message from its 'information'     - without this insight, digital communications cannot work</p> <p>timesharing is a technique for using the speed of the computer to present the appearance of multiple simultaneous users -  remember that computers were very fast in their computations, so a lot of the time computers were just sitting there doing nothing     - have a terminal connected to the machine         - if the terminal and machine are not very close together, you need to have a way of connecting the two together             - this is the modem IBM 2741, 1965 - direct connection in adjacent rooms, then on local phone lines     - long distance rates(high cost of communication) makes users work fast, which undermines purpose of timesharing</p> <p>once you could connect terminals to computers, people started asking how you could connect two computers - packet switching(originally called 'distributed adaptive messaging blockswitching' until donald davies from the uk gave it a better name) - developed independently in the US and UK at the same time Paul Baran of the Rand corporation begins thinking about secure communications - original system was go/no go via am radios to commanders in the field - develops 'distributed communication'     - uses nodes and switches in a way so that if one node is cut off, other nodes can still communicate with each other Baran's system was not hierarchical, any individual node could look out at different paths</p> <p>There were distributed networks before Baran - T&amp;T built their own system      -  messages with different priorities         - the node control was not autonomous, there was a central control system</p> <p>In the UK - Harold Wilson fears of losing out on tech     - Donald Davies, National Physical Laboratory - UK had initially shot themselves in the foot because they wanted everything to be centralized and have an immediate economic impact Davies unveils packet switching in 1966 - learns from a British military officer afterwards that it was already invented by Baran     - Davies reads Baran's work and says we don't need messages like 'kill', 'target', 'survivable' in a civilian context So he goes and proposes his idea to the post office - Post Office says absolutely not     - they don't see a value in this</p> <p>Back to the USA - SAGE computer, 1950's     - Lyndon Johhnson in 1965 directed agencies to support basic university research, and that centers of excellence should be created throughout the university         - Early computer science centres             - UCLA, SRI, Illinois, MIT     - Lawrence Roberts, ARPANET project, 1966 ARPA calls a meeting in 1967 of computer scientists with an interest in computerized communications - idea of computers that would act as a translators between the main processing computers     - you would only need to control communications between translators rather than between the larger computers     - here arises the need for packet switching - these translators and communicators are called IMPs(interface message processors)     - the thing that gets designed is a fusion of Baran and Davies's designs     - fewer of the cold-war survivability features, more of the high-speed transmission and adaptive features Because the UK wanted everything to have an immediate impact, it stalled their progress and the ARPANET overtook them</p> <p>SRI(Stanford Research Institute), 1968, Douglas Englebart demonstrates the NLS online system - 'mother of all demos'</p> <p>By focusing on the IMPs and how to automatically read the network for congestion and figure out the best route, a lot of local mainframe people are sidestepped - allows them to evade possible cultural backlash IMPs were built by BBN(Bolt Beranek and Newman, inc) - SRI comes up with the 'login' command</p> <p>October 29, 1969, the 'birth' of the internet - message between Charles Kline and Bill Duvall - really just depends on perspective, where do you want to define something as 'beginning'     - this date is not really the actual birth of the internet, but is just a handy date to have if you were forced to pick one</p> <p>the problem with building a history of the internet is that most versions of history are a whig history - told with an end goal in mind, simplistic explanation from beginning to end</p> <p>the 'birth' of the internet - it was a network, but one network does not make an 'inter'network</p> <p>In France - US and UK have bombs, France needs bombs too wtf     - French are a bit irritated because french computer companies get bought out by American companies - 1966 set up a research agency to compete with these other national agencies like ARPA     - lots of infrastructure set up - CYCLADES(1971), demo'd in 1973, fully operational in 1976     - named after the cyclades islands, 'islands' isolated in an ocean of data, brought together by networks to communicate with each other     - project was led by Louis Pouzin     - coins the term 'datagram' (data + telegram) - unlike ARPANET, where the router was responsible for the delivery of the data, CYCLADES made the hosts responsible    </p> <p>Meanwhile in the Pacific - ALOHANET, goes into use June 1971     - University of Hawaii, has campuses on each island         - instead of wire, 1968 department of Electrical Engineering begin planning a way to broadcast data over radio         - permits sharing of the main campus computer     - instead of always broadcasting, if terminals wait between broadcasts, you can send signals without interference</p> <p>SATNET - proposal from Larry Roberts in 1970 to connect ARPANET to UK National Physical Laboratory network     - comes intro fruition by 1973, but connects to University College London instead</p> <p>PRNET - Packet Radio Network     - inspired by ALOHANET, but aims to make things mobile     - a van with radio receiver/broadcaster that can use packets, is essentially a mobile router         -

16 May 1996 Amazon gets a front page article on the Wall Street Journal         - hugely important for Amazon, their sales boom         - amazon is still losing money, but Bezos is becoming incredibly popular in the media</p> <p>This is the strategy of the dot com boom     - have an idea doesn't matter if it's good, persuade a venture capitalist who doesn't want to lose out on the internet to invest in it     - burn that money to become as popular as possible, inflating the value of your company     -

Modem owners living in densely settled cities had a broader choice of local BBSs to call than people living in smaller towns did. In metropolitan areas, the concentration of boards encouraged sysops to specialize, resulting in BBSs that served communities of interest within the city.\"</p> <p>\"With the help of John Madill, a BBS sysop in Baltimore, Jennings developed a technique that allowed two BBSs running his \u201cFido\u201d software to automatically fetch messages and files from one another. After a year in operation, more than a hundred Fido BBSs were active on the network and \u201cFidoNet\u201d became an open standard for exchanging files and messages between BBSs.\"</p>"},{"location":"Topic%201/Memex%20Checkpoint%203/Source%20Notes%203/The%20Evolution%20of%20the%20Internet%20%E2%80%93%20Understanding%20Media%20and%20Culture/","title":"The Evolution of the Internet \u2013 Understanding Media and Culture","text":"<p>Source</p> <p>\u201c11.2 The Evolution of the Internet \u2013 Understanding Media and Culture.\u201d Accessed October 20, 2022. https://open.lib.umn.edu/mediaandculture/chapter/11-2-the-evolution-of-the-internet/</p> <p>Summary</p> <p>The article provides an overview of the development and evolution of the internet. </p> <p>The article explains concepts like 'decentralization', and looks at the history of the internet, starting with research on safe transmission of information during the Cold War. A decentralized network would help in the case of a bombing, as even if a few nodes were destroyed, information could still be transmitted using the surviving nodes.</p> <p>Multiple developments were made in order to get the Internet we have today, such as TCP/IP protocols and HTTP(check A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication for more info). The article also makes sure to go over the cultural impact things like Usenet, GeoCities, and Yahoo had on the Internet. </p> <p>Key Quotes</p> <p>\"During the Cold War, the U.S. military was concerned about a nuclear attack destroying the hub in its hub-and-spoke model; with this new web-like model, a secure voice transmission would be more likely to endure a large-scale attack. A web of data pathways would still be able to transmit secure voice \u201cpackets,\u201d even if a few of the nodes\u2014places where the web of connections intersected\u2014were destroyed.\"</p> <p>\"Two of the most important technological developments were the personal computer (such as the Apple II) and the dial-up modem, which allowed anyone with a phone line to access the developing Internet. America Online also played an important role, making it very easy for practically anyone with a computer to use the Internet. Another development, the web browser, allowed for access to and creation of web pages all over the Internet.\"</p> <p>\"With the advent of the web browser, it seemed as if anyone could make a website that people wanted to use. The problem was that these sites were driven largely by venture capital and grossly inflated initial public offerings of their stock. After failing to secure any real revenue stream, their stock plummeted, the market crashed, and many of these companies went out of business. In later years, companies tried to diversify their investments, particularly by using a \u201cfreemium\u201d model of revenue, in which a company would both sell premium services and advertise, while offering a free pared-down service to casual users.\"</p>"},{"location":"Topic%201/Readings/Bonnie%20Mak-%20How%20the%20Page%20Matters%28Ch.%201%29/","title":"Bonnie Mak  How the Page Matters(Ch. 1)","text":"<ul> <li>\"The page has played a central role in preserving the intellectual and artistic traditions of the West for over two millenia\"(pg 9)<ul> <li>the page is more than just a medium of transmitting ideas, the page itself is part of that message<ul> <li>ex. a scroll or codex, wear and tear of pages</li> </ul> </li> <li>the page gets often overlooked despite conveying meaning themselves</li> </ul> </li> <li>the introduction of the printing press in Europe and the invention of digital technologies a long time later were huge turning points regarding the production + transmission of information</li> <li>whether brittle, thick or stained, each page has its own unique identity forged by cultural forces over time<ul> <li>different reading communities cause pages to have different identities</li> <li>book designers decide what kind of page it is and how the page should be treated</li> <li>\"the construction of the page can be read as evidence of its social history\"(pg 10)</li> <li>long ago scrolls were made from papyrus from the Nile River<ul> <li>because papyrus was incredibly important for Mediterranean communities, changes in papyrus manufacturing indicate larger social changes</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>design of pages in the classical period showed that designers understood the page as an organizational tool that had an important role in the transmission of information<ul> <li>further on the design of clay tablets and codexes show that pages were designed to achieve a certain goal(ex. setting a writing space) beyond being merely tools to carry information</li> </ul> </li> <li>page design was a challenge at times to get right<ul> <li>correct imposition of images and text on pages was challenging for the under-experienced<ul> <li>evidence of errors in imposition seen in texts from the Middle Ages</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>the history of the page is filled with overlapping methods and means<ul> <li>codex and scrolls used in tandem in the Middle Ages<ul> <li>longer texts with literary characters transmitted by codex, while scrolls were used to transmit official documents and the like</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>style of script plays a role in determining the identity of a page<ul> <li>decisions around the style of script are influenced by social and political factors<ul> <li>letter forms can be seen as a reflection of the times</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>scholars often needed to refer to multiple texts at once<ul> <li>organizational patterns allowed designers to set commentaries and put multiple texts on a single page<ul> <li>in a way, this can be thought of as one of the earliest versions of the memex as talked about in Vannevar Bush- As We May Think<ul> <li> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Malcom Parkes notes that early copyists recognized the important role of headings and tables in the transmission of a text</li> <li>placement of images on a page is a signal from designers on how those images are meant to be read</li> <li>the page is a cultural artifact, and can be thought of as an early technological device</li> <li>\"readers interpret text, space, and image as they are inclined, but the meanings that they formulate are predicated upon the materiality of each carefully designed page\"(pg 21)<ul> <li>the page is an interface that represents an ongoing conversation between designer and reader</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Quotes and Annotations - In this section you can find quotes I deemed important from the text.</p> <p>to do: add more quotes and connections.

It enables the user to search documents, locate them on shelves, sections, libraries, etc. The catalogue lists the reading materials in a manner that the user can seek and locate documents by author name, titles, subjects, series, and editors which, down the ages, were considered efficient tools for tabulating the vast library resources of the library.\"</p> <p>\"Earlier, users have to visit the library to ascertain the availability of a particular document; today a user can do it outside the library. Library catalogues were merely locating tool to find information, current catalogues are capable of providing information at the spot without going to library shelves because of integration of electronic resources with it.\"</p> <p>\"Today, OPAC systems not only serve the purpose of catalogues but also provide unified or integrated systems covering almost all other library activities such as acquisition system, serial control system, circulation system, financial system, personnel management system and so on.\"</p>"},{"location":"Topic%201/Readings/Vannevar%20Bush-%20As%20We%20May%20Think/","title":"memex","text":"<ul> <li>science has brought humans many great things<ul> <li>improved food, clothing, shelter, increased security, increased knowledge of biological processes which leads to progressive freedom from    disease and an increased lifespan</li> <li>provided quick communication between individuals</li> </ul> </li> <li>growing mountain of research <ul> <li>bogged down by loads of specialization, but specialization is necessary for progress</li> </ul> </li> <li>truly significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential</li> <li>methods for reviewing and publishing research are old and inadequate for their purpose</li> <li>the summation of the human experience is expanding rapidly, and the means we use for parsing through it are not adapting at the same rate</li> <li> <p>machines with can now be constructed without much effort</p> <ul> <li>even if ancient egyptians understood how to build cars, they would have built very bad ones</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>compression of information to make it easier to store</p> </li> <li> <p>a record of the human race since the invention of the movable type could be stored in a van</p> </li> <li> <p>compression of information is not enough, needs to be organized in a way so that people can consult it</p> <ul> <li>not necessarily generally consulted, but organized for specialization</li> <li>nobody studies an entire library, they only focus on specific sections</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>once compressed, the sharing of information becomes a lot easier</p> <ul> <li>cut down on costs</li> <li>usage of photocells and microfilm</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>gives examples of current technology which can be extrapolated upon to help catalogue research/information in the future</p> <ul> <li>technology to help with repetitive activites which frees the mind to do more</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>our indexing methods are not great</p> <ul> <li>having found an item, you have to exit the system to find another item</li> </ul> </li> <li>human mind works by association<ul> <li>moves from one item to another by association of thoughts</li> <li>selection by association is preferable to association by indexing</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>'memex'     - device in which one stores his books, records, etc.     - works as a supplement to memory     - memex content is purchased on microfilm         - dropped into bulk storage     - indexing, user can input a certain code and get a certain record/book     - several projection positions so that one can consult multiple records at the same time     - tying two items together by associative indexing     - the progresses made in science allow humans to do many things, to create a repository of knowledge with the effectiveness       of that found in a memex would allow them to grow the human experience even more - relation to Mike Caulfield- The Garden and the Stream , Caulfield's representation of a memex is a garden.</p> <p>Quotes and Annotations - In this section you can find quotes I deemed important from the text.</p> <p>to do: add more quotes and connections</p> <p>\" Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual\"</p> <p>\"A record, if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted.\"</p> <p>\"Selection by association, rather than by indexing, may yet be mechanized.
