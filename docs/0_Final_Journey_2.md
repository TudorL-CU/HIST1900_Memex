(Side routes)
- I would add a side route through [[Telecommunications and Colonial Rivalry- European Telegraph Cables to the Canary Islands and Northwest Africa,1883-1914]], as well as [[From Cabling the Atlantic to Wiring the World]] and [[Bonnie Mak- How the Page Matters(Ch. 1)]]. Unfortunately, using these resulted in a very short journey, so I used the longer one and added these here as side material

Coming into this course, I didn't know much about the history of the internet, in fact that was one of the things that enticed me to enroll the course. Being a computer science student, computers are a constant appearance in my everyday life, so when I was looking for an elective and saw the course description, I remember thinking to myself "Isn't it a bit embarrassing that you spend all this time on your computer and on the internet yet you don't know anything about the history of it?". So I enrolled and now here I am, answering the final question of the course. Of course feeling obligated to do the course is hardly any motivation to get involved in it, so going into the tutorial level I wanted to choose something else that I could get interested about. One thing that caught my eye was how humans are connected, and it got me thinking about the history of human connection, and how it relates to the internet. Of these two goals, I answered both. The first goal I answered all throughout the entire course, especially pertaining the section we covered on transmission protocols for networked systems, such as TCP/IP(which funny enough I later also covered in one of my computer science courses). The other goal is the one I want to deep dive into.


One thing that really struck me was that essentially everything about networks and the internet is just one entity communicating a message to another. If you really think about it, sending an email to someone is sending them a message, your request communicates with servers, which then communicates with other servers and so on, which eventually communicates with that person, notifying them that you've sent them an email. In that sense, can we not say the true origins of the internet go back several hundred, if not thousands of years? But what does lighting fires in Greek times have to do with watching Youtube videos? They both communicate a message from one human to another, whether it be that enemy forces are fast approaching or that the new iPhone will have yet another camera. The history of human connection is tied as far back as our existence, and the modern internet is just an extension of the desire to communicate with one another. When communication is at risk, such as during wartime, innovations are made due to necessity of communication that advances our ability to send complex messages to each other. [[Mediums and Messages| Ciphers]] and codebooks used in Roman times lead to advanced cipher and code cracking machines seen in WWII, which in turn leads to the internet as we know it today, with large encryption techniques used to make sure nobody can hijack an email you send to your friend.
