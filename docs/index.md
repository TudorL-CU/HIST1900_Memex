Index for Tudor's memex.


Howdy! Here are some tips to navigate this page.


Topic 1 is the bulk of the website. 

You can browse through the atomic notes section to get the core notes I took out of the readings I read. If you want a more in depth look at the readings, you can navigate to my 'readings' section and find more in depth notes on those readings! At the end of those detailed notes is a quotes section where I put the quotes I found most important from the text.

The other pages not called 'atomic notes' or 'readings' are a various assortment of notes I took from class lectures, and contain information I thought important from them. This is still a work in progress as I don't want to drop random class notes all willy-nilly, but these are the ones that I took the most notes on, as having a whole page dedicated to just a few lines might be wasted space.
- of course, my plan is to eventually integrate ALL lecture notes into different pages throughout this site

The features tab is pretty useless at this point, although I don't want to remove it because I don't know if it will break anything.
