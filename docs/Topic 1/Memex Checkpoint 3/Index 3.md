Index for Tudor's memex checkpoint 3

Hi! You can look through all the new stuff I added to the memex checkpoint 2 here. Created this folder to differentiate between checkpoint 2 and 3

#todo: link to other students memex's

I added a somewhat more expansive tagging structure, I still need to add more, also need to create more atomic notes based from the readings.


You can look at the atomic notes for this section here: [[Atomic Notes 3]]
