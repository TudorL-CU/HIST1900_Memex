**Summary**


The article provides an overview of the development and evolution of the internet. 


The article explains concepts like 'decentralization', and looks at the history of the internet, starting with research on safe transmission of information during the Cold War. A decentralized network would help in the case of a bombing, as even if a few nodes were destroyed, information could still be transmitted using the surviving nodes.


Multiple developments were made in order to get the Internet we have today, such as TCP/IP protocols and HTTP. The article also makes sure to go over the cultural impact things like Usenet, GeoCities, and Yahoo had on the Internet.




**Key Quotes**


"During the Cold War, the U.S. military was concerned about a nuclear attack destroying the hub in its hub-and-spoke model; with this new web-like model, a secure voice transmission would be more likely to endure a large-scale attack. A web of data pathways would still be able to transmit secure voice “packets,” even if a few of the nodes—places where the web of connections intersected—were destroyed."


"Two of the most important technological developments were the personal computer (such as the Apple II) and the dial-up modem, which allowed anyone with a phone line to access the developing Internet. America Online also played an important role, making it very easy for practically anyone with a computer to use the Internet. Another development, the web browser, allowed for access to and creation of web pages all over the Internet."


"With the advent of the web browser, it seemed as if anyone could make a website that people wanted to use. The problem was that these sites were driven largely by venture capital and grossly inflated initial public offerings of their stock. After failing to secure any real revenue stream, their stock plummeted, the market crashed, and many of these companies went out of business. In later years, companies tried to diversify their investments, particularly by using a “freemium” model of revenue, in which a company would both sell premium services and advertise, while offering a free pared-down service to casual users."
