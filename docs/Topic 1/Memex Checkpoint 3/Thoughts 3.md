@[[Anatomy of an AI System]]
- Think about AI as a geological process. Is there a point where the production of AI becomes stagnated in the future due to lack of resources? How will this affect the future? related to @(mis)use of AI in [[Atomic Notes 3]], will less AI being produced result in a more powerful status for the few that remain? #ai
