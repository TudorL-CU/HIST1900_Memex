**Summary**

The authors strive to provide a in depth look at the political and economic factors that shaped the governance of the internet. The article takes a look at the role of various parties such as governments and corporations in shaping the governance of the internet. 


There is a divide in internet usage by gender, specifically by social support, autonomy of use, and online engagement.


The article looks at the difference in approaches between Canada and the United States when it comes to new technologies. In Canada, digital divide by income is closing, but is still more serious than divide by education. 


The authors found that public-policy initiatives have done more to close the divide in Canada than corresponding initiatives in the USA. They conclude that public investment in internet infrastructure and public education is a good idea.





**Key Quotes**


"There is significant evidence of a gender gap in Internet access, especially in terms of technical means, social support, skills, autonomy of use, and forms of online activity such as civic engagement. While there are public policy and education initiatives to encourage technology use by women—particularly at the high school level—there are few Internet access programs targeted specifically at women"(113)


"These reports distinguish between the causes and consequences of the digital divide: lack of physical access to technology and infrastructure, for example, by virtue of income, education, or geographical location, causes digital divides; those who are not connected, as a consequence, miss out on economic benefits. Hawkins traces these themes through digital divide research, finding that they have dictated much of the subsequent scholarship, and even policy, on the digital divide in the United States."(115)


"Originally, Internet use in Canada was concentrated among families with higher levels of income, but over the period of available data, Internet access has become distributed across all income categories"(123)


"In Canada, the digital divide by income has been closing, but itremains more serious than the digital divide by education. In the United States, the degree of concentration in Internet access among top education categories is matched by the degree of concentration among top income categories"(123)


"Internet access has become socially valuable, and many of the technologies for connecting to the Internet have become more affordable. Yet policy initiatives have sought to encourage Internet use where competitive markets alone were not allowing technology diffusion"(123)
