**Summary**


Edwards talks about his experience with BBS's when he was a child. These experiences include setting up a BBS with a modem, and being a sysop for his own BBS.


Edwards became greatly interested in BBS's, calling many BBS's and eventually setting up his own. During this time he met a BBSer called David Cothran, who acted as a mentor to him.

The author then reminisces on his other experiences running a BBS. 




**Key Quotes**


"Whereas the Internet is a huge connected web of systems with billions of users, most BBSes were small hobbyist fiefdoms with a single phone line, and only one person could call in and use it at a time. Although BBS-to-BBS message networks were common, each system still felt like its own island culture with a tin-pot dictator (the system operator—or "sysop" for short) who lorded over anyone who visited."


"And as for me, my identity as a BBS sysop is now fully integrated into my life in general. It's no longer a secret act or a role that split off but something I can embrace with pride as we all look back on that formative era together. Back then, we BBSers were the nerds, the weirdos. Now the whole world is using online services very much like a BBS, and they don't even know it."
