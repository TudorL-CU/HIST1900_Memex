Commercialization of the Internet
- The internet began as a sort of labyrinth, something to explore and dive into. Lots of personality. Over the years, with the commercialization of the internet, a lot of the personality has been lost and people are directed to a limited number of sites that contain a large portion of internet traffic
	- advertisement plays a role in this



Enshittification
- Enshittification can be summarized by this quote by Cory Doctorow:
	- "'here is how platforms die: First they are good to their users, then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then they die."
- "advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of consumers"
