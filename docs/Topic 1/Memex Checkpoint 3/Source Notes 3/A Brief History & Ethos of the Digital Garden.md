**Summary**

The author provides an overview of digital gardens and personal knowledge systems and their evolution.


The early web was almost this labyrinth type landscape with a Choose-your-own-adventure type experience.
- Note: this is a stark contrast to today where everything is streamlined into a small group of websites that are force fed to you


Talks about Caulfield's original article([[Mike Caulfield- The Garden and the Stream]] ) on digital gardening and its influence on personal knowledge


Six Patterns of Gardening
 
1.Topography over Timelines
- gardens are organized around contextual relationships and associative links

2.Continuous Growth
- gardens are constantly growing, evolving, and changing
- making a garden is low pressure compared to an essay where you have to get everything right immediately

3.Imperfection and Learning in Public
- gardens are imperfect, you need to make the status of your notes clear

4.Playful, Personal, and Experimental
- Gardens are unique, the whole point is that it's your own personal playspace
- contextualization is important

5.Intercropping & Content Diversity
- gardens are more than just a collection of links to each other

6.Independent Ownership
- Gardening is about your own personal garden, one that you control fully



**Key Quotes**


"These creators wanted to enable pick-your-own-path experiences, while also providing enough signposts that people didn't feel lost in their new, strange medium."


"Gardens don't consider publication dates the most important detail of a piece of writing. Dates might be included on posts, but they aren't the structural basis of how you navigate around the garden. Posts are connected to other by posts through related themes, topics, and shared context."


"Digital gardens should be just as unique and particular as their vegetative counterparts. The point of a garden is that it's a personal playspace. You organise the garden around the ideas and mediums that match your way of thinking, rather than off someone else's standardised template."
