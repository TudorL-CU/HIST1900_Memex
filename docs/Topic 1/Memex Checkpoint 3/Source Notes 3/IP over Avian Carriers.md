**Summary**


IP over Avian carriers is a joke concerning the carrying of IP traffic(packets) by homing pigeons. (background knowledge for IP communication can be found in [[A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication]])

Due to the inconsistent method of delivering packets, IP over Avian Carriers suffers from high latency(haha) and a high degree of packet loss(eaten by eagles?)

The article then goes over a real life implementation of this, and provides a humurous section on the potential risks, which includes carriers being attacked by birds of prey and carriers being blown of course. 

Although this method is not a viable way of transferring information, it has remained a funny concept and has found a place in internet culture.




**Key Quotes**


"IPoAC has been successfully implemented, but for only nine packets of data, with a packet loss ratio of 55% (due to operator error) and a response time ranging from 3,000 seconds (50 min) to over 6,000 seconds (100 min). Thus, this technology suffers from high latency."
