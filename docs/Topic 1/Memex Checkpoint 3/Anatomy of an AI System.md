**Summary**

Crawford and Joler explain how an AI system like Amazon's Alexa work, and how an incredibly vast and intricate set of systems interact to respond to a simple command such as "Alexa, turn on the lights".

To start, Alexa is constantly learning. Human voices are converted into text messages which are then checked across a database for potential answers. For each answer, Alexa checks the effectiveness of that answer(ex. was the same question asked again, was there an action following the question such as the lights being turned on), and with each interaction, Alexa updates the effectiveness of answers. 

The author says that when someone purchases an AI device, they are simultaneously a consumer(buys the device), a resource(voice commands are used to improve responses), a worker(continuously provide feedback to increase effectiveness of the device), and a product.

Delves into the geological and "Earth" aspect of technology and media, thinking of AI  devices and media as the result of a natural geological process, one that is an extension of human interaction.

The process of digital labour creates new accumulations of wealth and power.
- power in controlling extraction of materials and manufacturing

There is a dramatic difference in scale of income in different parts of the building process
- children working in mines would need 700,000 years of work to earn the same amount Jeff Bezos does in a day

Capitalism conceals from the consumer the process that goes behind making a product









**Key Quotes**

"A brief command and a response is the most common form of engagement with this consumer voice-enabled AI device. But in this fleeting moment of interaction, a vast matrix of capacities is invoked: interlaced chains of resource extraction, human labor and algorithmic processing across networks of mining, logistics, distribution, prediction and optimization."


"Put simply: each small moment of convenience – be it answering a question, turning on a light, or playing a song – requires a vast planetary network, fueled by the extraction of non-renewable materials, labor, and data"


" the user has purchased a consumer device for which they receive a set of convenient affordances. But they are also a resource, as their voice commands are collected, analyzed and retained for the purposes of building an ever-larger corpus of human voices and instructions. And they provide labor, as they continually perform the valuable service of contributing feedback mechanisms regarding the accuracy, usefulness, and overall quality of Alexa’s replies."
