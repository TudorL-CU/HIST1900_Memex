greek word 'tele' and 'phone' meaning 'far sound'

in telegraphy, people followed the money
	- results of telegraphy implied serious financial benefits to existing telegraphy
	- realized diffferent signals and so different messages could be sent down a single wire, prices became cheaper
	- were called harmonic telephones 

the missing piece
- variable resistence
	- M clarac found tubes with powered carbon could be put under pressure, and the amount of electrical resistence could be regulated through
	  that pressure
	- Kelvin had earlier shown that resistence to electricity in a wire could be modified by putting the wire under tension
- theory of language
	- 

the first sound recording was not a sound recording per se, but rather an image of the soundwaves

the supervening social necessity
	- improving the economics of telegraphy
	- emergence of the modern corporation
		- see value in cutting out the translation to code of messages and instead just talking to people directly

boston money market played a large role in helping the Bell telephone keep going

breaks and accelerators
	- business model for telephones
	- legal troubles

telephone uses
	- when different circuits of telephones were connected together, bandwidth was limited to be able to fit more calls on existing wires

early telephone exchanges needed specific architecture to fit switchboards which changed the layout of places like cities

bell labs were created to improve telephone technology and make them more useful long distance



first Bell company founded in 1875

first telephone exchange operated by Western Union's telephone subsidery

first women central office operator, 1878, Emma Nutt

Idea of assigning unique numbers to subscribers suggested in 1879

first automatic telephone exchange 1892
	- the Strowger automatic exchange

in the first two decades there was a very slow uptake of telephony
	- in the US at least, what about other places?

telephony was subject to interference from other electrical sources, e.g. trolleys, telegraph wires, thunderstorms


the national Bell becomes American Bell by a merger between Bell and another company
	- agreement with Western Union still holds up

1884 American Bell establishes a long distance line between NY and Boston
	- creates a subsidiary company to do this, AT&T
	- establishes a laboratory to improve long distance telephony

1888 all the court battles around original patents are won by Bell
	- Bell is making tons of money even though the rest of the economy is in a depression
	- patents are about to expire

Bell only has telephone wires up to Chicago, you have another whole half of a country doing stuff as well

by the 19th century most towns with at least 4000 people had at least 2 different telephone exchanges in their town/city

In the US, cost to subscribe to telephone companies per year were incredibly high
	- Washington- 100, New York- 240, meanwhile in Europe: Paris- 18


The lab to improve long distance telephony was called Bell Labs
	- had a deal where the more they could produce research, the more profit they were allowed to take 


Claude Shannon joins Bell Labs in ww2
	- invents information theory
- as an MA student, lays the foundations for modern digital technology
		- 1938 A symbolic analysis of relay and switching circuits
- Before Bell labs, he discovers that electrical circuits can do logic(OR, AND, NOT)

Redudancy is the key to understanding language and information theory


Shannon in 1948 took his idea to its logical conclusion and developed a way to think about a message as being composed of two things
	- the content, and the information
	- the information is the measurement of the redundancy of that content, or how 'surprising' the next sound is

a bit of information is something that has 2 outcomes, yes or no
	- if something can be described with one bit, it only has two possible outcomes


Alan Turing 
	- turing machine functions like a general purpose computer
		- functions with boolean expressions
		- operates with bits
		- uses punch cards that you feed into the machine

combine information theory with Turing's universal computer and you have a way for a machine computer to simulate any of the work tat a human computer could do

Babbage's design was essentially a souped up calculator
	- died out because there was not much necessity for it

counting machines didn't really become popular in the early 1900's
	- people didn't think they needed computers for business
	- counting machines used by 1930's germany(think nazis labeling population)
		- ibm sold these counting machines, arguments later on said that indirectly ibm played a significant part in the holocaust

'analog computers'
	- work well for things like differential equations
	- Kelvin proposes a way of linking multiple devices together to increase the complexity of simulations
	- however setting these things up is not easy
		- pretty much just using hammers and wrenches

George Stibitz
	- 1937 'model k', adding numbers together
	- 1940's experiments with sending messages from computers across phone lines

Konrad Zuse
	- phone calculator
		- s1, calculator to speed up missle production

Howard Aitken
	- designed an electro-mechanical calculator to help with his thesis work
		- military refuses it, but reviewing engineer wanted it, introduces Aitken to IBM and Thomas Watson
	- 'mark 1', Watson foots the bill

These 'calculators' has somewhat good enough social necessity in the 1930s and later on
	- not enough necessity for general purpose computers, but world war changes things

John Mauchly
	- secretary recreates a memo based on shorthand notes
	- ENIAC(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator/Computer)
		- first general purpose computer

All these men design computers and calculators, but never gave a thought on how to actually operate it
	- ignored WHO did the programming, and how long did it take to set the program up
		- 6 women did the programming(re-wiring and writing the pages)
			- took 15 seconds to get the result, but took a lot longer to set it up to get it to do the calculations
		- study the engineering diagrams, reverse-engineer it
		- this happened because there was already a big precedent on leaving math and programming to women
			- also a small role was that during ww2, not enough men and these jobs were deemed 'trivial'
- Mauchly's demonstration was a success
	- the men went to go have a party that night, didn't invite the women

Grace Hopper
	- programmer, eventually sits down with some business people and creates a language for their computers to inter-operate
		- that language eventually became COBOL(Common Business Oriented Language)

Women get positions of power due to programming, but still get no credit
	- the work that nobody valued is actually what everyone depended on
	- when people see that there is money involved, people push it to become male
		- these women programmers end up training their male replacements

the need for nuclear simulations drives a lot of innovation in calculations
	- not necessarily the impetus for creating the internet

	- timeline of computer history

Britain timeline
- Colossus
	- developed during WW2
	- emerges from an earlier machine called the Bombe
	- never fully declassified until well after the war
	- supervening necessity: German wolfpack, needed to break communications
- Enigma machine
	- is essentially a substitution cypher
	- increased amount of rotors increases the amount of settings for the enigma machine
	- the beginning of deciphering the device is realizing that no letter can ever be encrypted as itself
- Hut 8 and Bletchly Park
	- Germans have a hard cipher to decrypt
	- Turing worked in Hut 8 on computers during the war to break the german code
	- not as advanced as computers in the US, but there was more of a necessity for these machines
	- in 1942 germans slapped on another rotor to their enigma machine
		- eventually realize what the germans did and were able to decrypt it by 1943
	- these calculators were massively important in the war
Bombe to Colossus
	- Turing's teacher, Max Newman, leads the design of the colossus
	- colossus could suggest the best match for a pattern within a text
	- second colossus could figure out which pattern was the best to try
Post-War developments
	- multiple teams explore these machines
	- von Neumann writes a report on the EDVAC
	- the urgency was gone, there wasn't really a need for these machines anymore
	- the last technical hurdle to solve was the problem of memory

Back in the USA
	- project whirlwind
		- starts off as a kind of analogue computer meant to simulate flight on multiple kinds of airplanes during the war
	- most expensive of the various computing projects, navy loses interest due to cost as well as war being over
	- cold war takes over
	- airforce takes the machine as it was the only machine that could plot intercept course for strategic long range bombers
	- solves the problem of magnetic memory

Now back to britain
	- manchester baby computer
	- built to test another solution to the problem of memory
	- runs a stored program from memory in 1948
	
problem is allies stop sharing information in 1946 due to closing off data sharing by USA congress
	- so britain sets out to build its own nuclear weapons
	- all experiments ought to be centralised at the National Physical Laboratory
	- the 'official' british computer will be built at the NPL and turn to Turing to build it
	- Turing moves to manchester to work on computing in 1948
		- 1952 his house is burgled, and he calls the police
			- in the course of their investigation, Turing is forced to admit he is gay
	- Turing loses everything because society at that time hated gays, was arrested and found guilty of gross indecency
		- government gave him the choice of imprisonment or chemical castration
		- chooses castration, commits suicide in 1954, later pardoned in 2012
	- britain loses their industrial way because of their misogyny

history of the internet is implicated with the cold war

period of digital incunabula ends after the war
	- in the uk commercial versions of the manchester baby are being sold as general purpose computers by 1951
	- the digital age begins

IBM in the digital age decides to get in on making computers
	- idea of using re-purposing older calculators and making them into computers

20th century programming is still an issue
	- people like grace hopper are building compilers and high level languages to ease programming and provide interoperability
	- mostly male programmers liked the secrecy of the way things were, the mystery of it all

competences
	- existence of digital computers
	- existance of telecommunication networks
	- information theory
	- ideas around flow control and logic, algorithms
	- demonstration of control of a calculator over a phone line in 1940
- is it time for the internet yet?

idea of time sharing
	- these computers were so fast they spent a lot of time idle, is it really worth spending so much money on things that spent that time idle
	- different groups can share times on a computer to run different operations separately
	- might lead to one of the original ideas of the internet
- bulletin board in the 1970s
