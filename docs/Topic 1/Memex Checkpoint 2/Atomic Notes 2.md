Imperialism/Colonialism
	- Telegraphy set new horizons for imperialism. Countries could communicate and govern their colonies with much more effectiveness and efficiency. 
	- How does this tie into the future, which colonies get more political power, which ones get a headstart on technological advancement due to telegraph lines?
		- @Thoughts
		- #todo link specific atomic notes to thoughts, this one would be linking to the readings on telegraph lines in Africa and the one on Wiring the World

Erasure of Women
	- Women were incredibly involved in operating telegraph lines and operating early computers. Their names are erased from history. The first programmers were women, compared to today where programming is thought of as a mostly male profession.
	- #todo add proper linkages to class notes after you sort them out

Social Necessity
	- A social and political necessity always results in innovation in a field, and likewise lack of a necessity stalls the development of technologies
		- development of some telegraphs and succeeding calculators/computers was pushed back because governments/people didn't really see a use for it. In WW2 usage for computers increased and large developments were made because of the social necessity
	- does the geography of a country influence necessities?
		- @Thoughts for more detail
	- Money as a necessity
		- #todo: expand this and make it its own atomic note
