**Summary**

Quevedo examines the history of early telegraph lines to African colonies and the Canary Islands, and their role in pursuing and preserving colonialism. 

Quevedo marks the strategic location of different colonies and discusses how controlling and establishing telegraph lines to certain areas increases the power a nation holds.


Britain constructed telegraph lines to colonies such as the Canary Islands for better communication
- as a result, telegraphy came to these places relatively soon compared to the overall technological development of the region

European countries realized that controlling communication was instrumental in controlling a region, and so countries like England, France, and Germany constructed communication lines to colonies abroad, such as Morocco

Atlantic archipelagos became important for the role in intercontinental telegraphy



**Key Quotes**

"Telegraphy arrived at the Canaries quite soon compared to the technological development of the region"(Quevedo, 109)


"Therefore, the Atlantic archipelagos were essential strategic points for inter continental telegraphic connections"(Quevedo, 113)


"The Portuguese islands were the link of the telegraphic com munications to North America, while the Spanish archipelago would be the link to South America and all the colonies in the west coast of Africa"(Quevedo, 121)


"Thus, the control over the cables in north western Africa was an extremely significant matter discussed in depth at the highest level. It prompted the revision of the strategic value of the Atlantic archipelagos"(Quevedo, 124)
