**Summary**
The ARPANET(Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was the first public packet-switched network. This computer network was installed at UCLA in fall of 1969, in December of that year it had 4 nodes operating. By 1989, this network expanded into a collection of networks consisting of over 60,000 nodes.
The origins of the ARPANET come from the late 1950's, when the Department of Defense was concerned about the durability of their communication network in the case of a nuclear first strike attack against the US. After investigation, Paul Baran concluded that the most durable network would be a distributed network in which the loss of a number of nodes/links would not affect the sending of information from one node to another.
The rapid growth of the network led to a reworking of the end-to-end protocol, changing it from NCP(Network Control Protocol), to a pair of protocols called TCP(Transport Control Protocol) and IP(Internet Protocol). 
***note: TCP/IP protocols are still the dominant communication model even today in 2023***
The author says that the foundations of networking that ARPANET laid the foundation of have not only influenced the future of networking technology, but has also led to shifts the everyday human practices.
Finishes by posing questions about computer networks concerning security and private information stored on computer networks, and if/how you can truly make 'trusted computer systems'.


**Key Quotes**
*(on a distributed computer network)*"would have sufficient redundancy so that the loss of subsets of links and nodes would not isolate any of the still-functioning nodes; there would be no central control; signals would traverse a series of nodes from source to destination, the exact route being determined by the set of working nodes and links at a particular time; and each node would contain routing information and could automatically reconfigure that information within a short time after the loss of a link or node."(Denning, 530).

"Networking has had an effect on the world more profound than that of the more spectacular and expensive Apollo moon mission"(Denning, 532).

"A central question that arises from the interpretation of the Arpanet as part of a new technological discourse is, What other discourses will inevitably come together in the arena created by networking, and how can the design of networking in the future accommodate them? I see four major discourses: scientific technology, business, higher education, and government."(Denning, 533).

"If human practices external to a system of computers and networks generate distrust among those who must coordinate action, how can monitoring, auditing, and access control mechanisms restore trust?"(Denning, 534).
