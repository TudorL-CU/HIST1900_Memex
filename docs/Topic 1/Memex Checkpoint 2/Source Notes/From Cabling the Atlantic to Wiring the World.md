**Summary**

The laying of the transatlantic telegraph cable was one of the most important moments in somewhat recent history. The cable led to many other cables being being laid from Europe to places like India, Southeast Asia, and Australia. By the late 1870's, almost any major commercial center could be reached from Europe via telegraph.

The author likens telegraphy to globalization, using the history of wiring the world to suggest so.

The expanding of telegraphy lines resulted in a global integration of many areas around the world

- the resulting capabilities and services that cable delivered produced large social changes, and influenced the perception of time, distance, and relationships between countries

The cables made imperalism possible where it seemed unlikely

- Strengthened colonisation in countries far away from their coloniser such as India and the UK

- Communication in these areas focused more on continued colonisation rather than globalization

The instantaneous messaging using telegraphy and the medium in which telegraphy was used(immaterial communication) gave way to innovations such as futures trading that were previously not possible

**Key Quotes**

"the Atlantic cable was "the wire that changed the world," as historian Gillian Cookson astutely put it in her book tide"(Muller, 508)

"Telegraphy = globalization, the history of the wiring of the world commencing with the Atlantic cable of 1866 seems to suggest."(Muller, 508)


"in the nineteenth century, mail and telegrams went hand in hand with everyday colonial communication."(Muller, 513)


"the cables among other technologies as the key that made 'imperialism possible where it was otherwise unlikely,' "(Muller,515)


"This loss of materiality in communications enabled new forms of market interactions such as futures trading that relied on information about goods that the investors never possessed."(Muller, 517)
