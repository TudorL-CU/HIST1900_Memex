Archaelogy
	- the science of human duration
Theory is a framework for understanding the world and directing your attention
	- theory tells you what is important and helps frame your questions
	- there are many different theories to order our observations

complicated vs complex systems
	- complicated system is one with mechanical equipment which is controllable(ex. rocket ship)
	- complex system is one in which the parts of the system are dynamic(ex. queensway)

assemblage theory
	- agencement is the idea that things come together
	- the meaning depends on the context
		- nothing is meaningful on its own
		- a pot does not exist as the pot itself, but rather as the joining of different components of the pot
- assemblage theory is especially important when looking at [[Vannevar Bush- As We May Think]] , the relations between pieces of information attributes more meaning to them

perspectivism
	- the way we record information matters
	- we try to mirror 'natural breakages' but there are many ways to make decisions
	- categories emerge from our engagement with the material

a network is present whenever there is a relationship between two entities along which information flows
	- networks form a substrate for social life, and humans aren't the only things that can have a social life
	- networks leave physical traces
	- more complex phenomena can emerge from interactions in networks
	- networks provide a formal mechanism through which computation can happen
		- computation is inherent to the shape of the network
	- components of a networked history are not just the technical objects, but also the assemblage
- the assemblage of networks to make the internet, the physical relationships between networks and humans, example would be [[The Evolution of the Internet â€“ Understanding Media and Culture]]

questions to ask when researching/learning
	- what are the social/political/economic contexts of things?
	- what are the assemblages that make this thing up?
	- how do those assemblages extend in time and space?
	- how do networks intersect?
	- what drives network evolution?
	- how do we study these things?
