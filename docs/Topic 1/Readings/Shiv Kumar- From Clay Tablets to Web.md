- abstract
	- evolution and development of library catalogues from clay tablets to the web
- accumulated knowledge is stored in libraries
	- treasure trove of books and records
	- libraries use classification and catalogue as tools for locating and retrieving materials
		- classification arranges items in a systemic order, catalogue helps identify and locate documents
		- catalogue is an index that lists library resources and arranges them in a recognizable order
- in ancient times, libraries were devoted to acquisition and preservation of reading materials
- ancient bibliographic information was stored on clay tablets
- libary indexes and the way information was stored changed throughout the ages

- in early days, cataloguing was a local and individual library practice
	- each library constructed a catalogue best suited for its own purposes
	- bibliographic records were in forms peculiar to each library but lacked a system
	- librarians gradually realized the benefits of co-operation between libraries and began working on standardized systems
- pre-aacr(anglo-american cataloguing rules)
	- british museum first major cataloguing code
	- american Charles Jewett was influenced by this code and wrote his own rules
	- in india S.R. Ranganathan designed another cataloguing code
	- International Conference on Cataloguing Principles(ICCP) in 1961 is one of the most significant events in the history of cataloguing
		- held in Paris, also known as the 'Paris Principles'
- aacr era
	- appeared in 1967 based on Paris Principles
	- published in British and North American editions
	- emphasis on conditions of authorship rather than types of work
	- International Meeting of Cataloguing Experts(IMCE) in 1969 in Copenhagen
		- International Standard Bibliographic Description(ISBD) 1971
	- many developments and updates were made to the AACR over the years
- modern trends
	- with the emergence of information technology(IT), web based cataloguing followed
		- creation of the online public access catalogue(OPAC)
- OPAC
	- computerised catalogue of reading materials available in a library
	- OPAC has at least 3 distinct functions
		- acts as a bibliographic database or e-version of the card catalogue it replaced, working as an index
			- also provides links to e-texts, freeing the user from having to physically locate books on library shelves
		- functions as a portal similar to a library homepage
			- provides information such as holds on books, overdue books, loan length, etc.
		- works as a promotional artifact, advertising the presence of a library and the services it can provide
	- OPAC is used as an information retrieval system, offering multiple types of searches(advanced search, boolean search, etc)
	- advantages of OPAC
		- greater number of access points for a single record
		- access to wide coverage of information quickly
		- access to information that may not be available in printed form
		- more current information since online databases are updated quicker and more frequently
		- eliminates need for tedious work such as typing and arranging catalogue cards
		- faster search facilities
	- historical development
		- sixties to early seventies
			- computers mainly used for production of catalogues
		- mid seventies
			- computers affected more processes, such as circulation control
			- cooperative cataloguing and resource sharing
		- late seventies to early eighties
			- developed hardware and software packages for libraries
			- ability to search bibliographic records online
				- early search could search by title or author only and had to match the name of the library holding
		- mid eighties to late eighties
			- OPAC became very popular
			- libraries implemented integrated library management systems
			- upgrades in search methods, adding boolean operators, did not require exact author or title match to find information
				- ability to restrict searches to specified fields made things more user friendly
			- reservation system which allowed users to place holds on books
			- ease of use and user friendliness were major features of OPACs of this era
		- nineties
			- variety of library management systems
				- some systems/networks were not compatible with each other
			- more improvements in search capabilities such as free text search
			- easy access to bibliographic information by using GUIs like Windows
				- made things even more user friendly and accessible
				- sped up and simplified searching by using Windows interfaces(mouse, pointer)
	- OPAC features
		- interactive interface
			- makes OPACs more interactive and easier to use
			- allows communication between users and the system in an interactive manner
		- types/methods of searches
			- advanced searches offer a multitude of ways to search for items in the database of a library
				- can broaden/restrict searches
		- access points
			- can search for information in a variety of ways not available in a traditional catalogue
			- some searching methods include
				- searching by author, title, series
				- searching by subject
				- searching by keywords
				- browse searching
			- search limits allow users to refine/limit searches to make searches more meaningful
			- user assistance/online help 
				- the system can provide help to the user to search for documents
			- OPACs provide holding information to show status/location of volumes/documents and whether or not a document is on loan
			- the user of an OPAC can access it through terminals
				- inside the library via local area networks(LAN)
				- outside the library via wide area networks(WAN)
			- OPACs can provide external links to electronic texts or files located all over the world
	- Web-OPAC
		- utilises www protocol to deliver a catalogue
		- programmed so a library user can access an OPAC remotely
		- major advantage is that their usage is global, and a user can access them anytime from anywhere
	- Web-OPAC features
		- typical GUI features such as pointing devices, drop down menus, etc.
		- usual features of traditional OPACs
		- usage of hypertext links to navigate through bibliographic records
		- appearance and search features similar to those found in traditional search engines(ex. Google)
		- linking to full-text when available
		- convenience in searching all types of information available through one interface
- Conclusion
	- there have been many changes in both conventional and non-conventional catalogues throughout the ages
	- the objectives/functions of catalogues are independent of their physical forms
		- however technology influenced the way in which these functions are carried out
	- the digitization of catalogues have led to additional features being added to catalogues
		- changes which would have been extremely difficult if not impossible to implement in physical catalogues
	- modern OPAC systems work as catalogues but also provide library services such as serial control, personnel management, etc.
	- OPACs have come a long way from their origins, but there are many more ways to improve upon them
	- OPACs are a tool to be used on the quest for knowledge, and their evolution is a reflection of this quest
