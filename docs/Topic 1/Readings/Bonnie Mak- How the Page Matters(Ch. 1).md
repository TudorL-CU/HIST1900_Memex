- "The page has played a central role in preserving the intellectual and artistic traditions of the West for over two millenia"(pg 9)
	- the page is more than just a medium of transmitting ideas, the page itself is part of that message
		- ex. a scroll or codex, wear and tear of pages
	- the page gets often overlooked despite conveying meaning themselves
- the introduction of the printing press in Europe and the invention of digital technologies a long time later were huge turning points regarding the production + transmission of information
- whether brittle, thick or stained, each page has its own unique identity forged by cultural forces over time
	- different reading communities cause pages to have different identities
	- book designers decide what kind of page it is and how the page should be treated
	- "the construction of the page can be read as evidence of its social history"(pg 10)
	- long ago scrolls were made from papyrus from the Nile River
		- because papyrus was incredibly important for Mediterranean communities, changes in papyrus manufacturing indicate larger social changes
- design of pages in the classical period showed that designers understood the page as an organizational tool that had an important role in the transmission of information
	- further on the design of clay tablets and codexes show that pages were designed to achieve a certain goal(ex. setting a writing space) beyond being merely tools to carry information
- page design was a challenge at times to get right
	- correct imposition of images and text on pages was challenging for the under-experienced
		- evidence of errors in imposition seen in texts from the Middle Ages
- the history of the page is filled with overlapping methods and means
	- codex and scrolls used in tandem in the Middle Ages
		- longer texts with literary characters transmitted by codex, while scrolls were used to transmit official documents and the like
- style of script plays a role in determining the identity of a page
	- decisions around the style of script are influenced by social and political factors
		- letter forms can be seen as a reflection of the times
- scholars often needed to refer to multiple texts at once
	- organizational patterns allowed designers to set commentaries and put multiple texts on a single page
- Malcom Parkes notes that early copyists recognized the important role of headings and tables in the transmission of a text
- placement of images on a page is a signal from designers on how those images are meant to be read
- the page is a cultural artifact, and can be thought of as an early technological device
- "readers interpret text, space, and image as they are inclined, but the meanings that they formulate are predicated upon the materiality of each carefully designed page"(pg 21)
	- the page is an interface that represents an ongoing conversation between designer and reader


Quotes and Annotations
- In this section you can find quotes I deemed important from the text.

to do: add more quotes and connections. Also, this will take longer than other sections because the source contained images and so you have to copy down the quotes by hand rather than copy-paste.
