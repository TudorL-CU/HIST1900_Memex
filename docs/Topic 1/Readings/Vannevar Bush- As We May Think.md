- science has brought humans many great things
	- improved food, clothing, shelter, increased security, increased knowledge of biological processes which leads to progressive freedom from 
	  disease and an increased lifespan
	- provided quick communication between individuals
- growing mountain of research 
	- bogged down by loads of specialization, but specialization is necessary for progress
- truly significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential
- methods for reviewing and publishing research are old and inadequate for their purpose
- the summation of the human experience is expanding rapidly, and the means we use for parsing through it are not adapting at the same rate
- machines with can now be constructed without much effort
	- even if ancient egyptians understood how to build cars, they would have built very bad ones

- compression of information to make it easier to store
- a record of the human race since the invention of the movable type could be stored in a van

- compression of information is not enough, needs to be organized in a way so that people can consult it
	- not necessarily generally consulted, but organized for specialization
	- nobody studies an entire library, they only focus on specific sections
- once compressed, the sharing of information becomes a lot easier
	- cut down on costs
	- usage of photocells and microfilm

- gives examples of current technology which can be extrapolated upon to help catalogue research/information in the future
	- technology to help with repetitive activites which frees the mind to do more

- our indexing methods are not great
	- having found an item, you have to exit the system to find another item
- human mind works by association
	- moves from one item to another by association of thoughts
	- selection by association is preferable to association by indexing

'memex'
	- device in which one stores his books, records, etc.
	- works as a supplement to memory
	- memex content is purchased on microfilm
		- dropped into bulk storage
	- indexing, user can input a certain code and get a certain record/book
	- several projection positions so that one can consult multiple records at the same time
	- tying two items together by associative indexing
	- the progresses made in science allow humans to do many things, to create a repository of knowledge with the effectiveness
	  of that found in a memex would allow them to grow the human experience even more

Quotes and Annotations
- In this section you can find quotes I deemed important from the text.

to do: add more quotes and connections

" Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual"

"A record, if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted."

"Selection by association, rather than by indexing, may yet be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and clarity of the items resurrected from storage."
