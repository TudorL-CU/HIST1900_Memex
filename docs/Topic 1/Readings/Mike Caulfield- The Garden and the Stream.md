1. A year in the garden

- Caulfield is experimenting with a form of social media named federated wiki
	- instead of blogging and tweeting, put experiences into a wiki that becomes a representation of things you know
		- connected to the wikis of other people and the things they know
	- excitement is found in building the complexity of an idea
		- creating connections between ideas and building upon those connections
	- over time all the connections you have and ideas form a network that helps you think
- a connection between two articles produces far more meaning than those two articles by themselves
	- (Advancements in library cataloguing and easier access to information leads to more connections being made-> more meaning produced?)
- believes the way we collaborate on the web is out of balance
	- says the predominant form of the social web(amalgam of twitter, instagram, facebook, etc.) is a poor model for learning
	- get past the "web as conversation", focus on something more timeless and integrative


2. The garden and the stream

- two different approaches to the web
	- the garden
		- the web as topology, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another
		- things don't collapse into a single set of relations, every walk through the garden creates new paths and meanings
			- a bridge in the garden looks different from each vantage point, no one correct approach to viewing the bridge
		- when you add things to the garden you add them in a way that allows future unpredictable relationships
		- each part of the garden connects with each other part to create infinite experiences and meanings to each individual viewer
			- timeless in that historical aspects of the garden(ex. which tree was planted first) doesn't matter
				- what matters is the connection they make
		- federated wiki is a version of the garden, something bigger than holding a single narrative or meaning
	- the stream
		- contextual, replaces topology with serialization
		- you don't walk around the stream or go to the end, you jump in and let it flow past you, things hitting you as they float by
			- applies to twitter, news alerts, etc.
			- you let your twitter feed take you where it takes you, news hits you as the stream of information rolls by you
		- your actions(tweets, comments) are contextual, form a narrative
		- the stream represents a single, time-ordered path
		- to understand something in the stream, you must know the context behind it(who wrote it, the context they had for writing it, etc.)
			- in a way this makes the stream inhospitable to strangers, you have to know so much to understand the context of something in the stream


3. The original garden

- references Vannevar Bush's 'As We May Think'
	- coincidence?? I think not, feel free to check out my notes on that article if you want some background info for this section, specifically the 'memex' section
- the memex is not actually a publication device, but it is a tool to think with
	- no replying or leaving comments, just linking to and annotating your own information or the information of others
	- links are associative and not just a quicky way to get source material
- connections are not conversation, but the construction of a model of a subject area
	- this model can be taken by others and be extended or improved upon
- Caulfield believes that through this method humanity can truly advance, not through conversation but by collaboration


4. Enter the stream

- Why is the internet, then, not this 'garden' of connections?
	- because of who has the power to change things, make annotations, and make copies
		- control what people intake
		- if you want to read something, you have to read it on someone else's server where you can't make changes
			- ex. news articles
	- web became server centric
		- good at distributed conversation, emergence of blogging
	- twitter and other sites improved on this notion of blogging
		- now you have a page that represents you, and then a 'feed' which represents others you're connected with
	- because of these innovations, the web became a series of conversational trails instead of associative ideas
- the stream is not bad, in fact it can be very good, but it is incomplete, and can be fixed to be better


5. Implications

- Open Educational Resources(OER)
	- for certain topics there is a lack of clear explanation on that topic(ex. the influence of local subsidies on development)
		- there are lots of journal articles and blog posts engaging in conversation with others regarding this topic
		- lots of conversation, lots of context needed. Many people engaging in the stream, none in the garden
	- many people say what they think about that topic, but there is a lack of base level explanation of it
	- a billion of people sharing their thoughts on social media, but only around 31,000 active wikipedians on English Wikipedia
		- compared to the entire english speaking world, that number is incredibly tiny
- Learning Design
	- there will always be people who are 'popular'
		- referenced and quoted more than other people
		- even in the memex, there are bound to be people who get linked to more than others(perhaps through good reputation)
	- however a 'garden' type thing like the memex would still improve drastically the bridging of social boundaries
- Tools
	- Open Educational Resources can benefit greatly from garden type technologies
	- open source textbooks for particular topics can be created easily using associative information


6. Green shoots

- we might be starting to see a shift recently concerning the rebirth of garden type technologies
	- in 2015 web annotation broke out into the mainstream
	- github taught people that making copies is good
	- emergence of wikimedia
- Caulfield believes that we can make a world so much better than the current one if we get out of the 'stream' for a little while and focus on building a 'garden'




Quotes and Annotations
- In this section you can find quotes I deemed important from the text.

to do: add more quotes and connections

"The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another."

"Things in the Garden don’t collapse to a single set of relations or canonical sequence, and that’s part of what we mean when we say “the web as topology” or the “web as space”. Every walk through the garden creates new paths, new meanings, and when we add things to the garden we add them in a way that allows many future, unpredicted relationships."

"In the stream metaphor you don’t experience the Stream by walking around it and looking at it, or following it to its end. You jump in and let it flow past. You feel the force of it hit you as things float by."

"It’s not that you are passive in the Stream. You can be active. But your actions in there — your blog posts, @ mentions, forum comments — exist in a context that is collapsed down to a simple timeline of events that together form a narrative."

"In other words, the Stream replaces topology with serialization. Rather than imagine a timeless world of connection and multiple paths, the Stream presents us with a single, time ordered path with our experience (and only our experience) at the center."

"we can imagine a world, I think, so much better than this one, if only we can get our heads out of the Stream for a bit, and build the Garden we need."
