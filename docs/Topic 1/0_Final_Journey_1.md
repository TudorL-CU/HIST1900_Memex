- [[Comparing Digital Divides- Internet Access and Social Inequality in Canada and the United States]]

(Side routes)
- between [[Thoughts 3]] and [[Atomic Notes 3]] I would have the context tag. 
- between [[Atomic Notes 3]] and [[My Secret Life as an 11-Year-Old BBS Sysop]] I would have the necessity tag
- between [[My Secret Life as an 11-Year-Old BBS Sysop]] and [[The Evolution of the Internet – Understanding Media and Culture]] I would take a quick detour through the section on gardening to get to [[Archaeology, Theoretical Framework]], before coming home to [[The Evolution of the Internet – Understanding Media and Culture]]


**Foreword**

I either added too many links between notes or didn't have enough notes to have the links create meaningful stories, and now all my Journeys are akin to the 5 clicks to Hitler variation of [the wikipedia game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game). As such, I added some side routes to expand on what I felt were important to properly answer the question "what is the most powerful thing you've learned in this course".

**Answer**

Something that wasn't specifically brought up in many notes but was present in the background of the entire semester was the idea of context. Many people think of history as just a timeline of events, when in fact it is incredibly damaging to view of history this way. This is because we get so used to this timeline of events that we begin to think of history as just this one objective thing to look at, when in actuality history depends on the context you look at it from. The history we are taught in schools and see growing up is just one context, and for people all around the globe history can take on many different timelines and many different contexts. For example, [[Thoughts 3 | the context when looking at the history of the internet]] can change depending on what geographical region you're from. And it's their where our journey begins. [[Comparing Digital Divides- Internet Access and Social Inequality in Canada and the United States]] is an interesting article that looks at inequality and the governance of the internet, and looks at the divide between internet use by gender and other criteria. With so much of modern life taking place on the internet, disparities and different groups of people being more prevalent on the internet than others can lead to unintentional framings of history. Having diverse contexts and views is essential to maintaining a constructive society, but when people in power push for one context becomes the overwhelming majority, it leads to a more objective version of history being taught, which is bad. One stellar example of this is computer science culture today. Programming has a stereotype for being a male dominated field, and [the statistics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1126823/worldwide-developer-gender/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20global%20software,reality%20of%20software%20development%20jobs.) certainly back this up. But when you look at history, hasn't it always been this way? Indeed, on the objective timeline lots of computer science discoveries and programming designs were by men, such as the ENIAC. However, if you do more research, you find out that the vast majority, if not all, of the people who actually inserted the cards into the computer were women. So, programming to start off was a women dominated field, so why is it so male dominated now? Well, you can say it is because the context behind programming shifted. In early computer science, programming was thought of as a largely menial task, it was something that nobody valued, so the men handed it off to the women. Because the perception of programming was that it was an irrelevant job, these early women never really got written into the timeline of history, unlike their male counterparts. The men in charge, when eventually seeing that there is money to be made in programming, push for their male colleagues to be programmers, pushing women out of the industry. This of course had an absolutely massive impact on the perception of programming by the general public, as well as changing its historical context. The context for programming changing from 'for women' to 'for men' because of the powerful people that wanted it to be that way, we end up in the situation we're in today. This of course relates to the geographical context of the internet as questioned in [[Atomic Notes 3]], where I ask what would the history of the internet look like from the context of Russia, or other countries? We largely know the americanized version of the history of the internet, well because Canada is next door to them, but also because of their historical status as a world power. When one entity holds so much influence, they can control how people perceive things. When [over 50% of internet content is in english](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_used_on_the_Internet), you can begin to see how the anglosphere, and largely US based companies, can influence what content people talk about, and what specific historical contexts for events people are aware of. The things people are aware of is made worse by user content, bringing us to Benj Edwards article on [[My Secret Life as an 11-Year-Old BBS Sysop]]. The emergence of online communities was probably the first step towards the enshittification of the internet, despite the good they bring. When companies realized they could take advantage of large online communities based on specific niches, like a computer company advertising in a programming community, the arms race began. The commercialization of the internet involves an obscene amount of money(suprise, those in power are seen interfering wherever there is money to be found), and advertisers and people in power can use online communities with large userbases to spread propaganda. This same problem can be seen with other websites such as Google and Youtube, in which an algorithm decides what information is relevant to you. If the algorithm can be controlled to only show you certain contexts of events, most people are not going to go too far out of their way to background check those contexts, and so the objective historical timeline gets reinforced.  [[The Evolution of the Internet – Understanding Media and Culture]] mentions the money involved in social media, and internet business. With countless websites looking to diversify their revenue streams, it's not hard to see how advertisers could come along and invest money in these social platforms, with the seemingly innocent caveat of "give my content a bit more views please". 


With the increasing prevalence of the internet and online social platforms in everyday life, you can get stuck in a tunnel of being shown one thing after another, with advertisers controlling what you see, and powerful entities pushing you to see what they want you to see, influencing your views and thus your perception on history. In an era with so much (mis)information, it is becoming increasingly important to really think about what you're reading/watching/doing, and understand the context behind that piece of content. This is why I believe that the most powerful thing taught in this course was not who invented the internet or why social media exists, but that we have to look at all these things, and look to understand the different contexts behind them, whether it be the reasons why a a news outlet is covering an event in a certain way, or anything else you're not.
