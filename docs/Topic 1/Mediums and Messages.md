- the medium is the message
	- the medium is as important as the message

A medium is something that carries something else

Media comes in different 'classses'
	- classification of media and cataloguing controls knowledge and what is important
	- who decides what is important?
		- whoever makes that decision gains importance/power
		- makes their vision of the world the most important one

classifications both reflect and direct our thinking. The way we order represents the way we think
	- Stephen Jay Gould, 'The Titular Bishop of Titiopolis', Natural History 90: 22 1981

- possession of a medium is very important
	- ex. libraries, ownership of libraries equates to ownership of knowledge
	- libraries reflect the world back to itself 
		- makes them targeted 
		- if parties can control who owns the knowledge, then they can control how knowledge is distributed #context 

printing press
	- enabled fast replication of messages

Melvil Dewey(1851-1931)
	- Dewey Decimal System
	- created a universal system for cataloguing books
		- most public libraries use this system even today

#memex 
	- [[Vannevar Bush- As We May Think]]
	- associative indexing
		- any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another item so that numerous items have been
		  thus joined together to form a trail

invention of the digital computer does not happen long after these large shifts and reorganizations of information


1965- Hypertext
	- original idea of hypertext is not the same as what it is today
		- you see what the article is based on, and you see future work that uses that article
	- today, hypertext is just a one way pointer from a citation to a source


- tags are hashtags that allow you to tag what notes are about

- atomic note is a note on an observation in the text
	- you can take that observation and put it in an idea note
- atomic notes come from other people, idea notes come from you

ciphers
	- your enemies would be able to read your writing
		- need to encode it so only your allies can read it
secret messages are not only what is in the message, but how the message moves

code: variable sized elements that have meaning in the plaintext language
	- syllables, words, phrases
cipher: transformation of plaintext according to some transformation
	- small fixed number of substitution elements

Roger Bacon
	- describes various systems of secret writing known to him
	- may have encrypted the secret of the philosophers stones

nomenclator
	- mixture of substitution cyphers and codebooks
	- susceptible to frequency analysis and context dependent guessing
	- popular in diplomatic circles 1400-1800

When you hear a story like this, ask yourself
	- where are the gaps/what is left out
	- where are the women in this story
	- what other things had to have happened to support all this?
