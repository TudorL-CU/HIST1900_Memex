The telegraph and transmitting messages

- tech can exist as assemblages
- assemblages can be thought of as complex systems
- in the right conditions, complex systems can evolve

- networks powered by electricity

historiography
	- evaluation of historians themselves

Winston's framework
	- supervening social necessity #necessity 
	- innovation does not come out of nowhere, it comes out of a need for something/it has a role to fill
	- suppression of radical potential
		- in a new technology, things will try to push it forward, but things will also try to pull it back/make it safe
- semaphore used for communication was a precursor to the telegraph
- initial pushback on innovation due to lack of want for change
	- comfortable with what you know
- first railroad emerges
	- hundreds of miles of railroads emerge
	- how to communicate between trains, need to make sure trains don't crash into each other
	- emergence of the railroad necessitates fast communication
		- in turn pushes the telegraph forward
- samuel morse
	- morse code
	- uses his connections to learn about different inventions such as magnets, telegraph, etc.
	- uses magnetic relays to increase distance of messages with less wire
- develop messages in code to distribute messages more easily
	- easier to learn morse code than to make enough circuitry to get the message to work
- morse strings his wires along trees and builings from baltimore to washington

- accelerating forces
	- emergence/rising popularity of stock market and stock companies and need to buy/sell stocks
		- quick transmission of sales, can trade stocks with knowing things other people do not
		- ability to trade things quickly without other people knowing
	- newspapers, editors were interested in using the telegraph to get info that other newspapers had
- telegraph puts an emphasis on being first
- Henry O'Reilly secures patents from Morse to use morse telegraphs
- Cooke and wheatstone have american patents prior to morse, tried to sue him because their patents were first
	- competing services, but Morse's was better so Cooke and Wheatstone tried to take it down
	- Morse was eventually triumphant in courts
- privatization of communication companies
	- leads to big ramifications in the future with the modern internet

- lots of vandalism, people trying to screw each other over
	- 1851 Morse triumphant and consolidation of telegraph lines in the US
	- by end of 1860s only Western Union was still standing
		- >150 companies absorbed
		- 35k+ miles of cable
		- 2250 telegraph offices
- international telegraphy
	- 1842 Morse puts experimental cable across the New York Harbour
	- 1852 Frederic Gisborne lays cable between New Brunswick and PEI
	- 1858 the Atlantic was crossed, read [[From Cabling the Atlantic to Wiring the World]] for more info
		- unwinding cable as the ship crosses the atlantic
		- takes them 3 tries to get the cable working
		- few weeks later it stops working because Edward Whitehouse tries limit testing
		- later use Lord Kelvin's idea
	- individual states begin to realize that control of international communication matters
	- Britain is especially advantaged, due to their global reach and colonies
- implications of international telegraphy for colonialism
	- takes about 100 days to sail from London to Hong Kong
	- distance collapsed, messages can be transmitted over thousands of miles within seconds/minutes
	- then what is to stop a state from expanding its reach?
- gutta percha
	- tree resin type material
	- if you heat it up, you can fashion it into different shapes
	- equivalent material to plastic for that time period
	- can use it as an insulator
	- without gutta percha, there is no trans-atlantic cable and as a result no long distance telegraphy
	- #colonialism played a role in cabling the world
